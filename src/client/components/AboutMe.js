          I'm a software engineer with a passion for designing and building full stack apps. 
          I've been developing software for five years, both personally and professionally. 

          My latest project is a web application that allows users to practice investing 
          in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and track their performance over time. It's a 
          great introduction to the volatile cryptocurrency market. Check it out at woolfey.com- 
          you can view most of the pages without needing to create an account!

          I have an advanced level of proficiency with JavaScript (ES6), Python, SQL, 
          React + Redux, Angular 4, Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, 
          MySQL, CSS3 + LESS/SASS, HTML5, Bootstrap.js, jQuery, and Redis.

          I'm also experienced with AWS (Amazon Web Services), EC2, S3, Django, Flask, 
          Cron, and Docker.
